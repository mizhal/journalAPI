Feature: journal-writing
	As a journal user
	I want to write texts to record or explain things I want or need to remember, keeping new ideas out of my head but in a safe place
	And I want to refer places, people, companies in an unambiguous form 
	And I want to record/log the progress made in my quests and tasks (and projects)
	So I will be aware of the process involved in questing and tasks and trace actions and decisions made
	And I will elaborate arguments with supporting information
	And I will remember easily the context of a quest when I have to abandon it for a while.
