Feature: quest-tracking
	As a journal user
	I want to keep track of "open ended" objectives like information search, research or loosely defined problems I have to solve
	So I record steps taken, plan steps required and avoid running endlessly around the same partial problems or already known or found information.
	And I can access quickly to contacts (people), places and other relevant information I need to carry for quest completion
	And I have a log of the journey.
