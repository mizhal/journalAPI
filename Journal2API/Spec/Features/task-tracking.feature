Feature: task-tracking
	As a journal user
	I want to keep track of every simple or "fixed" objective for which I have all the information needed to complete it from the start.
	So I know if they are done or I must complete them.

	Scenario: Start a task
	Scenario: Delete a task
	Scenario: Archive a task
	Scenario: Update task data
	Scenario: Set task status to "done"
	Scenario: Set task status to "fail"
	Scenario: Set task status to "next"
	Scenario: Revert task status to "to-do"
	Scenario: Annotate something related to the task in the General Journal
